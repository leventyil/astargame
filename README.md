In the game where the enemies advance to the castle by using a map and necessary
mechanics on Unity, the player is deemed to have lost the game when a certain
number of enemies cross the castle border. Enemies are advancing on the shortest
path to the castle by using A* algorithm. By observing this movement of the
enemies, player is defending the castle by making it difficult for the enemies to
advance with defensive tools and obstacles.

Player can put obstacles in the way. After that enemies calculate a new path and use it.
A* algorith is coded, not used from plugin.
